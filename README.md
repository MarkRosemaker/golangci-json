# golangci-json

Marshal [golangci-lint v2](https://golangci-lint.run)'s `config.Config` to JSON.

```go
import (
	"log"

	"os"

	golangcijson "github.com/MarkRosemaker/golangci-json"
	"github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/pkg/config"
)

func main() {
	var cfg = config.Config{
		Version: "2",
		Linters: config.Linters{
			Default: config.GroupNone,
			Enable:  []string{"tagalign"},
			Settings: config.LintersSettings{
				TagAlign: config.TagAlignSettings{Align: true, Sort: true},
			},
		},
	}

	if err := golangcijson.MarshalWrite(os.Stdout, cfg); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

```json
{
  "version": "2",
  "linters": {
    "default": "none",
    "enable": [
      "tagalign"
    ],
    "settings": {
      "tagalign": {
        "align": true,
        "sort": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting YAML

This package only produces JSON - but you can convert it to YAML:

```go
import (
	"encoding/json/jsontext"
	"os"

	golangcijson "github.com/MarkRosemaker/golangci-json"
	"github.com/MarkRosemaker/json2yaml"
	"github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/pkg/config"
	"gopkg.in/yaml.v3"
)

func Example_yaml() {
	var cfg = config.Config{
		Version: "2",
		Linters: config.Linters{
			Default: config.GroupNone,
			Enable:  []string{"tagalign"},
			Settings: config.LintersSettings{
				TagAlign: config.TagAlignSettings{Align: true, Sort: true},
			},
		},
	}

	b, _ := golangcijson.Marshal(cfg)
	node, _ := json2yaml.Convert(jsontext.Value(b))
	_ = yaml.NewEncoder(os.Stdout).Encode(node)
}
```

```yaml
version: 2
linters:
    default: none
    enable:
        - tagalign
    settings:
        tagalign:
            align: true
            sort: true
```

## Why this exists

golangci-lint's own `config.Config` decodes a config file via
[mapstructure](https://github.com/go-viper/mapstructure) — its fields are
tagged `mapstructure:"tab-len"`, not `json:"tab-len"` or `yaml:"tab-len"` — and offers nothing for
the reverse direction. Marshaling it with `encoding/json` directly falls back
to raw Go field names (`TabLen`) with every zero value spelled out.

This package fixes that by hand: for every type in `config.Config`'s field
tree, a matching *shadow type* declares the same fields with `json` tags
instead of `mapstructure` ones, and a custom marshaler converts one to the
other before encoding. The type conversion (`tagAlignSettings(v)`) only
compiles when the two types have identical fields — so when golangci-lint
adds, removes, or retypes a field, **this package fails to build** rather than
silently marshaling the old shape. That's a deliberate trade against a purely
reflection-driven approach: a build breaking on a golangci-lint upgrade is
strictly better than a config file that goes quietly wrong.

## Omission is per field, not automatic

A field is written only when it differs from what leaving it out of a real
config file would mean. For most fields that's the Go zero value — but
several booleans across golangci-lint's linters default to `true` (`usetesting`'s
`os-chdir`, `tagalign`'s `align` and `sort`, several `unused` checks, and
others), cross-checked against golangci-lint's own `defaultLintersSettings`
and `defaultFormatterSettings`. For those, the shadow type omits no zero
value: an explicit `false` is always written, so it can never be confused
with "not set" and silently replaced by golangci-lint's own default.

One consequence follows directly from using plain Go values: a settings
struct is itself omitted when *every* one of its fields happens to be the Go
zero value, because a value type has no way to represent "this key was
present with every field at its default" separately from "this key was
absent" — golangci-lint's own decoder has the identical limitation, for the
identical reason. In practice this means: set every field of a settings
struct whose true default you want to keep, not only the ones you're
changing — leaving a field off is Go zero, never "keep the default".

## Types that embed via `,squash`

A few golangci-lint types embed another with `mapstructure:",squash"`,
meaning the embedded struct's fields decode into the *same* map as the
embedding type, not nested under a key. JSON's embedding rules look similar
but aren't: an embedded field with a registered marshaler for its type is
promoted using its own (Go) field names, completely bypassing that marshaler.
Every such type — `ExcludeRule`, `SeverityRule`, `GoModGuardv2Blocked`,
`TagliatelleCase`, `TagliatelleOverrides`, `Text`, `Tab`, `JUnitXML` — is
therefore marshaled by hand in `squash.go`: the embedded value through its own
shadow type, the type's own fields (if any) through a small anonymous one,
merged into a single object.

## What's covered

Every struct type reachable from `config.Config`'s field tree — 143 types —
has a shadow type and a registered marshaler. `Config` itself is handled by
explicit field assignment rather than a type conversion, since it carries two
unexported fields (`cfgDir`, `basePath`) that make direct conversion across
packages illegal.
